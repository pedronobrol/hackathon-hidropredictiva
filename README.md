# HidroPredictiva Hackathon Solution

This repository contains the solution developed during the HidroPredictiva Hackathon.

## Description

At the HidroPredictiva Hackathon, the primary objective was to develop innovative solutions that enhance the efficiency of predictive algorithms for optimizing the management of hydroelectric resources in Spain. This initiative seeks to increase the contribution of renewable energy to the energy mix by harnessing technology, artificial intelligence, and green algorithms.

A central focus of the hackathon was on improving **carbon efficiency** and **explainability** in predictive models, alongside accuracy. Our project aligns with these goals by emphasizing not only the accuracy of predictions but also the importance of understanding how these predictions are made and their impact on carbon emissions.
